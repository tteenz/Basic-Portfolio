                <p>Hello! My name is Tina and I am a part of the UC Berkeley Boot Camp program. Our program started on
                    September 8th, 2018.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was born and raised in San Jose although I hope to move someday to Seattle or possibly San Diego.
                    I love all things Disney even though my first time ever going was a year ago! I love the fall and
                    the cold so I'm super excited for October to come around.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm short, but always full of energy...most time anyways. I love to hike, but also love eating all
                    sorts of food. I love going to the wilderness because nature is beautiful. I love going to the
                    beach to listen to the sound of the waves.
